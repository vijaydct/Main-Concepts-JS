1) function component
    - reusable
    - work in isolation 
    - independent

name- should be in capital
1 input called as props
return react elements

2) class component
    - retain data inside the component means we can store the data inside the component
    - can not we store the data inside the function component? yes you can, but everytime you have to rerender the element or component when value of the variable changes
    - in class component, you no need to rerender the element or component when value of the variable changes. it will automatically rerender when value of the variable change
    - this is the biggest advantage of class component over the functional component
    - you can reffer the 13-render.html file 
    - state which will be object

 3) can we update state directly? Yes, but we should not do it this way, because, state value changes but the component doesnot re render

    instead we use the setState method, to ensure we not only change the value of the state but it also re render the component
